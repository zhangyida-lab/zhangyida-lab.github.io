## Production methods

### Make-to-stock (MTS)

What is Make-to-stock (MTS)?
Make-to-stock (MTS) is a manufacturing strategy in which production planning and production scheduling are based on forecasted product demand. Products made during one production period are used to fulfill orders made in the next production period. This means that in make-to-stock production planning, production is triggered prior to and independent of specific customer orders.

### Engineer to Order (ETO)

In ETO, after an order is received, a part of or the whole design starts to be developed. Construction by general contractors and plant construction by engineering companies are categorized as ETO.
Engineer to order is a production approach characterized by

Engineering activities need to be added to product lead time.
Upon receipt of a customer order, the order engineering requirements and specifications are not known in detail. There is a substantial amount of design and engineering analysis required.

### Assemble to Order (ATO)

This strategy requires that basic parts of the product are already manufactured, however not yet assembled. Once a customer's order has been received, the parts of the product are quickly being assembled and sent out.

Together with the BTS approach, these strategies form the spectrum of order fulfillment strategies a firm can adopt.

### Build to Order

BTO: sometimes referred to as Make to Order or Made to Order (MTO)，it is a production approach where products are not built until a confirmed order for products is received. Thus, the end consumer determines the time and number of produced products. The ordered product is customized, meeting the design requirements of an individual, organization or business. Such production orders can be generated manually, or through inventory/production management programs. BTO is the oldest style of order fulfillment and is the most appropriate approach used for highly customized or low volume products. Industries with expensive inventory use this production approach. Moreover, "Made to order" products are common in the food service industry, such as at restaurants.

BTO can be considered a Just in Time (JIT) production system, as components or products are only delivered just in time when demanded, in order to reduce wasted time and increase efficiency.
