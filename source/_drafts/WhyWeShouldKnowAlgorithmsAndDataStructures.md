Algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem.If you don't know algorithms well, you won't be able to identify if you can optimize the code you are writing right now.

Data Structure is used for organizing the data in memory. There are various ways of organizing the data in the memory, for eg. array, list, stack, queue, and many more.

Data structures allow us to organize and store data, while algorithms allow us to process that data in a meaningful way. Learning data structure and algorithms will help you become a better programmer. You will be able to write code that is more efficient and more reliable. You will also be able to solve problems more quickly and more effectively.


Data structures and algorithms complement each other. The data structure exists for the algorithm, and an algorithm generally suits a specific data structure.

Generally speaking, a data structure is a way to organize data, while an algorithm is a method or pattern for solving problems.

To illustrate this, let’s say you want to find a specific book in a library.

Because computer can only do simple thing,but it can do thing very fast;it can store large number data.so as a programmer we need Algorithm and Data structures.

计算机只能做简单的事情，并且可以存储大量数据，因此需要程序员知道如何数据结构和算法。计算机的内部实现类比图书馆，如何组织存放图书，如何快速查找图书。
