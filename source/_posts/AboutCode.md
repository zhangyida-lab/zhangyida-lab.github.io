# AboutCode

## about program structure

In any other programming language, one builds large programs from a small set of basic constructs. Variables store values. Simple expressions are combined into larger ones with operations like addition and subtraction. Basic types are collected into aggregates like arrays and structs. Expressions are used in statements whose execution order is determined by control-flow statements like if and for. Statements are grouped into functions for isolation and reuse. Functions are gathered into source files and packages.

## about data type

It’s all bits at the bottom, of course, but computers operate fundamentally on fixed-size numbers called words, which are interpreted as integers, floating-point numbers, bit sets, or memory addresses, then combined into larger aggregates that represent packets, pixels, portfolios,
poetry, and everything else. Go offer savariety of ways to organize data, with a spectrum of data typ es that at one end match the features of the hardware and at the other end provide what programmers need to conveniently represent complicated data structures.

## about function

A function lets us wrap upasequence of statements asaunit that can be called from else where
in a program, perhaps multiple times. Functions make it possible to breakabig job into smaller pieces that might well be written by different people sep arated by both time and space.
A function hides its implementation details from its users. For all of these reasons, functions areacritical part of any programming language.

## about interface

Interface types express generalizations or abstractions about the behaviors of other types. By generalizing, interfaces let us write functions that are more flexible and adapt able because they are not tied to the details of one particular implementation
