## \# What is Data Structure and  Algorithm?

Algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem.If you don't know algorithms well, you won't be able to identify if you can optimize the code you are writing right now.
Data Structure is used for organizing the data in memory. There are various ways of organizing the data in the memory, for eg. array, list, stack, queue, and many more.

Data structures allow us to organize and store data, while algorithms allow us to process that data in a meaningful way. Learning data structure and algorithms will help you become a better programmer. You will be able to write code that is more efficient and more reliable. You will also be able to solve problems more quickly and more effectively.

Data structures and algorithms complement each other. The data structure exists for the algorithm, and an algorithm generally suits a specific data structure.

Generally speaking, a data structure is a way to organize data, while an algorithm is a method or pattern for solving problems.

To illustrate this, let’s say you want to find a specific book in a library.

Because computer can only do simple thing,but it can do thing very fast;it can store large number data.so as a programmer we need Algorithm and Data structures.

计算机只能做简单的事情，并且可以存储大量数据，因此需要程序员知道如何存储数据、读取数据，这就是涉及到我们的主题——数据结构和算法。计算机的内部实现类比图书馆，如何组织存放图书，如何快速查找图书。

## \# What thing can Data Structure and  Algorithm do on computer science?

- Organization of data in a computer’s memory

- Representation of information in databases

- Algorithms that search through data (such as a search engine)

- algorithms that manipulate data (such as a word processor)

- algorithms that analyze data (such as a data miner)

- algorithms that generate data (such as a random number generator)

- algorithms that compress and decompress data (such as a zip utility)

- algorithms that encrypt and decrypt data (such as a security system)

- software that manages files and directories (such as a file manager)

- software that renders graphics (such as a web browser or 3D rendering software)

## \# What thing can Data Structure and  Algorithm do on daily life?

- change the way you remember things
- find a more efficient solution
- you can bulid your own **"tree"**
