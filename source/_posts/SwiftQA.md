## How to use swift to development an ios APP

## The idea of this application

## What is first-class type ?

Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.

## What is type-safe language?

Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code requires a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake. Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that requires a non-optional String. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process

“An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task”

“There are three essential building blocks in all algorithms: sequencing, selection, and iteration”

Organizing Data
“Instances, Methods, and Properties”

“Much of the code you write for an app is event-based, executing in response to a constantly changing environment.
”

“Apps receive all kinds of input: touches on their screens, files, sensor input (such as a camera), data from the internet. Inputs can even come from other programs. For example, you can use the Share sheet in your Photos app to send a photo to another editing app, or to include it in a message to your friend. When it comes to output, apps can return images, sounds, music, text, tactile sensations, and animations.
”
