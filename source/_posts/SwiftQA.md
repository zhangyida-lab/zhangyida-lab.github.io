## How to use swift to development an ios APP

## The idea of this application

## What is first-class type ?

Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.

## What is type-safe language?

Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of your code requires a String, type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake. Likewise, type safety prevents you from accidentally passing an optional String to a piece of code that requires a non-optional String. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process
