## The Trouble with filler Words

- The fillers get in the way of the emotional stories or fascinating research you’re trying to share.
- If you want your audience to buy into your message, you have to make it clear, logical, and easy to follow.

## How to find your filler words

- Record using your phone to identify your filler words.

- Once you’ve become cognizant of your filler words as they try to escape your lips, begin forcing yourself to be silent.

- Finally, I can’t stress the importance of **preparation** enough. Nerves are one of the biggest reasons people overuse vocal fillers. The less prepared you are, the more nervous you’ll be, which will likely cause you to speak too quickly, trip over your words, and forget what’s next.

## How to aviod your filler words

- Learn to the Pause

  - Collect your thoughts: If you lose your train of thought, a pause gives you time to get back on track. As long as the pause isn’t too long (no more than five seconds), the audience won’t hold it against you.
  - Calm your nerves: Taking a pause before starting a speech is especially important for people with a fear of public speaking, as it helps calm nerves. The tactic is useful in the middle of a speech as well. If you find yourself getting flustered, pause briefly to take a deep breath (as long as it’s not audible or obvious) and reset.
  - Build suspense: Pauses aren’t always a defensive tactic. Strategically placed silence can build suspense, emphasize a point, or give the audience time to absorb a key insight
- More practice,recording what you speak everyday such as these speaking prompts

  - what do you do
  - how do you help your clients
  - what service do you offer
  - why should i work with you
